# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra comes from 2 words. _Linear_ & _Algebra_.

1. **Linear**
   * Which means of, or relating to a line of lines. Another way of thinking about it is something having predictable sequential / proportional effect.
        > Think about moving from point **a** - **b** whereby the distance between **a** and **b** is 10 steps in a straight line. If take 1 step at a time 7 times towards **b** from **a** you would be 7 steps away from **a** but 3 steps closer to **b**.
        >
        > This 7 steps indicates the **sequence** of steps made away from **a**. The 3 steps remaining to **b** indicates the **proportional** relationship that every step away from **a** takes you proportionally closer to **b**.

2. **Algebra**
    * Comes from Arabic <span style="color: #66ccff">"al-jabr"</span> which literally means **the reunion of broken parts**. It is a branch of mathematics concerned with describing relationships between values (know & unknown) utilizing letters and symbols to represent/abstract these values and their relationships.

        > In other words you could think of it a a field of study that seeks to tell the whole story by showing the relationships of the broken/ unknown parts parts.
        >
        > For instance lets begin with the equation:
        >
        >$$x + 4 = 7$$
        >
        >This tells us a broken story/ incomplete story that when we add *something* to 4 we should get 7. And because we don't know what this <span style="color: red">"something"</span> is we represent it with <span style="color: red">"x"</span>.
        >We can further explore the relationship between **x** and 4 and 7 by writing 4 as.
        >
        >$$x = 7 - 4$$
        >
        >This draws a clearer picture that:
        >
        >$$x = 3$$
        >
        > So the complete story is that:
        >
        >$$3 + 4= 7$$
        > From this we can draw an abstract conclusion that if we have an expression:
        >
        >$$a+b=c$$
        >
        >Then
        >
        >$$a=c-b\quad or \quad b= c-a$$

So the more strict definition of Linear Algebra is:

>The branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as
>
>$$a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n=b,$$
>
>and linear functions such as
>
>$$(x_1,...,x_n)\mapsto a_1x_1+...+a_nx_n$$
>
>and their representation through matrices and vector spaces.

In my own words i think:

>Linear Algebra is the branch of math interested in establishing a complete picture given a system of linear equations with many unknowns. It tries to tell the complete story by using the line like relationship between these equations
