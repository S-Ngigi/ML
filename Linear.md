# Vectors

Broadly speaking there are 3 distict bu related ideas of what vectors are.

1. **Physics Prespective**
    * Vectors are arrows pointing in space. What defines a given vector is its length (magnitute) and direction it points to.
    * As long as the two above remain the same you can move your vector around but it still remains the same vector.
    * Vectors living in the flat plane are 2D and those sitting in broader space are 3D
2. **Computer Science Prespective**
    * A vector is an ordered list of numbers. For example [2, 1] represents a 2 D vector for indicating quanitity you need to by to get a free item
2. **Math Prespective**
    * This perspective seeks to generalize both these views as long as we can add or multiply these vectors.


**Note**
- The top number in a vector(list) represent the x axis and the bottom number the y axis

- To distinguish vectors from points the conventions is to write vectors vertically using square brackets around them. White points are written in parenthesis. (-4, 2)
